# Malware_Detection_Webapp
Malsite is a malware detection and honeypot detection tool. The idea for this project came when I was just browsing through the internet searching for some torrent sites. Most of the time I have experienced sites which redirect users to some different sites which often collect data and at times monitor the visitor activity to harm the person. Currently, there are tons of tools present on the but every single one of them fails to detect and curb the remote data capture/sniffing attacks that usually hackers carry out to steal your identity.  This tool is developed by keeping these factors in consideration. Developing it on such strong fundamentals we expect it to be used as an extension by common people in future and are working tirelessly to realise this dream.
